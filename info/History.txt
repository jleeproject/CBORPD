Version 1.0.0. (2021/03/16)
1. All classes are modularized.
2. Conducted experience over Levy Function (d=6).
3. DiRect algorithm is used for both Infill Sample & GP.

Version 1.0.1. (2021/03/16)
- Draw sample lengthwidth from normal distribution with mean MLE and small sigma 


Version 1.0.2. (2021/03/19)
- Error fixed: Variance of error functions were wrong.
- Constrained optimization is under development.
  - Structures are built. not correct yet.

Version 1.1.0. (2021/03/20)
 - Developed: Optimization under uncertain constraints.
 - Developed: Visualization of constraints.
 - Developed: GP for the observation mean that has the variance plugged in by the mean function of GP of log samples.
 - Bug fixed: diRectOpt: has several bugs in constrained optimization. 
    1) Especially, the bug in 'DIRdivide' that terminates in the middle of iteration after max-iteration is critical. It produces infeasible solution at the end.
    2) In 'CallConstraints', point' should be used instaed of point.
    3) double(Problem.constraint(i).func) is not working. Instead, replaced by 'if strcmp( func2str(Problem.constraint(1).func), func2str(Problem.f))'.
 - x_mu_history : The history of estimated minimum points. (minimum of mu function while considering the constraints).
    - P( C(x) )<=0.05 is used for the constraints: Conservative solution.
 - x_history : The history of evaluated points. (argmin = acquisition function (x))

Version 1.1.1. (2021/03/22)
 - Rectified visualizations (both online & final results)
 - Made: import problems.
 - Added Toy problems: Gelbart14, Gardener14-1, Gardener14-2, Ariafar19.

Version 1.1.2. (2021/03/23)
 - Class objects are copied at each experiment. Previously, the physical address is used.
 - Modified bugs about visualizations.
 - For the results from V1.1.1, 'visualize_results_v2_for_v_1_1_1' can be used, which reset the parameters.
 - Modified bugs on the last sample size. Final sample size = budget - cumulative samplesize.
 - Functions scales were readjusted so that the problem is solvable.
 - They can be tested with three levels of difficulties: easy, medium, hard
 - Multiple dimensions are now be able to be visualized.

Version 1.1.3. (2021/03/23)
